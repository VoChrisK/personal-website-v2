Hello there!

My name is Chris and I am a programmer and creator. I enjoy creating exceptional

I began my journey into software development when I built a couple of games on ROBLOX using their own in-house game editor and **Lua** on my own. That was well over a decade ago. Today I am a professional software developer who has made significant contributions to enterprise applications used by thousands of people. I am proficient in developing full-stack applications and I have professional experience and expertise in a variety of modern technologies.

In my spare time, I like to play video games and keep myself fit through hiking, running, lifting, and climbing. I also like to read, cook, and travel.
