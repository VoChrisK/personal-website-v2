Hello there!

My name is Chris and I am a programming and technology enthusiast. I enjoy creating things and solving problems using my main arsenal: code!

I began my journey into software development when I first built and programmed a couple of simplistic games on ROBLOX using the scripting language Lua. That was well over a decade ago. Today, I am a professional software developer who have made significant contributions to enterprise applications. I am adept in full-stack development and I have professional experience and expertise in a variety of modern languages and technologies.

In my spare time, I like to play a lot of video games (League of Legends and Runescape to name a few) and exercise (weightlifting, rock climbing, and running). I also like to hike, read, and cook from time to time.
