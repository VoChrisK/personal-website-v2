An app where users can experiment on the Twelvefold Way, a systematic classification of twelve formulas relating to two finite sets in Combinatorics. Users are able visualize how each formula work under the hood, by placing either [balls into bins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balls_into_bins_problem) or [stars in between bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)).
