My personal portfolio website built from the group up using **Gatsby.js** and hosted on **Netlify**. I referenced [Brittany Chiang's Website](https://brittanychiang.com/) as a starting point, but I built everything else on my own. The website is responsive as it has both a desktop view and a mobile view depending on the resolution.
