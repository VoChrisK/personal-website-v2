title: 'Caesar Cipher'
type: 'Personal Project'
---

A project where users are able to encrypt any word or phrase of their choice. The encryption technique used is called Caesar Cipher where each character in a word or phrase is shifted up or down in ther alphabet based on a given offset. (Fun fact: I have demoed this project twice in a professional setting in order to teach Cypress to new hires!)
