Hello there! My name is Chris and I am a programming enthusiast. I enjoy creating things and solving problems through coding!<br>

I began my journey into software development when I first built and programmed a couple of simple games on ROBLOX using the scripting language Lua. That was well over a decade ago. Today, I am a professional software developer who have made significant contributions to various enterprise applications. I am adept in full-stack development and I have professional experience and expertise in a variety of modern languages and technologies. I am currently on an amazing team in Fidelity Investments where I work alongside with developers, analysts, and designers to build an accessible digital experience to guide people into retirement.<br>

In my spare time, I am an avid video gamer and hiker. I enjoy playing a multitude of video games, both single-player and multi-player (League of Legends, Runescape, Elden Ring, etc.), and escaping to the outdoors to explore the nature around us! I also like weighlifting, running, movies, and music. Most importantly, I am always down to try out new things!<br>

Skills: TypeScript, Angular, Jest, Cypress, GraphQL, CSS, HTML, Node.js
